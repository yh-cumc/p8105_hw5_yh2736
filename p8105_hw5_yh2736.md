# Problem 1

``` r
##funtion "fun_replace_na" to replaces missing value
fun_replace_na = function(x_vect){
  if(!is.numeric(x_vect) && !is.character(x_vect)){

  } else if(is.numeric(x_vect)){
    mean_value = round(mean(x_vect, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)
    replace(x_vect, is.na(x_vect), mean_value)
  } else if(is.character(x_vect)){
    replace(x_vect, is.na(x_vect), "virginica")
  }
}

##replace the missing data of dataset "iris_with_missing"

# Problem 2

``` r
##set the file path
file_path <- "./data"

##get file name
csv_file_names <- list.files(file_path) %>% 
  .[str_detect(., ".csv")]

##dataframe with all file name
file_names_dataset <- csv_file_names%>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    type = substr(value, 1, 3),
    id = substr(value, 5, 6)
  ) 
```

    ## Warning: Calling `as_tibble()` on a vector is discouraged, because the behavior is likely to change in the future. Use `tibble::enframe(name = NULL)` instead.
    ## This warning is displayed once per session.

``` r
##dataset with all observations
observation_dataset <- csv_file_names %>% 
  purrr::map(~read_csv(file.path(file_path, .))) %>% 
  reduce(rbind) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
